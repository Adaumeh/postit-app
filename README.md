#PostIt

Introduction
PostIt is a simple application that allows friends and colleagues create groups for notifications. This way one person can post notifications to everyone by sending a message once. The application allows people create accounts, create groups and add registered users to the groups, and then send messages out to these groups whenever they want.
 
This project is broken down into phases and completion of all phases would contribute greatly to your learning towards becoming a world-class developer. Upon completion, you would have built a world-class full-stack JS application (front-end and back-end).
